# DasmaQL - Work in Progress
DasmaQL is a self-contained query tool designed for data selection with a simple and intuitive language. This project is currently a work in progress, aiming to develop a query language parser that can be utilized for structuring a backend application.

## DasmaQL Language Description
DasmaQL is a flexible query language designed to express and manipulate data queries in a structured format. It supports a variety of operations, including conditionals, ordering, and functions, making it suitable for a wide range of data analysis and manipulation tasks.

### Syntax Overview
#### Expressions
Expressions are the core of DasmaQL queries, allowing for complex data manipulation through logical operations such as `AND` and `OR`, as well as grouping with parentheses `()`.

#### Ordering
DasmaQL supports ordering results using `ORDER BY` followed by one or more field names, optionally specifying `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending) order.

##### Conditions
Conditions in DasmaQL are built using terms that compare fields against values or other fields. Supported operators include:

* `=`: Equal to
* `!=` / <>: Not equal to
* `>=`: Greater than or equal to
* `<=`: Less than or equal to
* `>`: Greater than
* `<`: Less than
* `~=` / `~`: Like (for pattern matching)

#### Functions
DasmaQL allows for calling functions as part of expressions, providing extensibility for custom data processing and analysis.

##### Special Constructs
* `IN`: Checks if a field's value is within a specified list of values.
* `NOT IN`: The inverse of `IN`.
* `BETWEEN`: Checks if a field's value falls within a specified range.
* `NOT BETWEEN`: The inverse of `BETWEEN`.
* `LIKE`: Performs pattern matching against a field's value.
* `NOT LIKE`: The inverse of `LIKE`.

##### Comments
DasmaQL supports comments using the `#` / `--` symbol. Comments are ignored by the parser and can be placed anywhere whitespace is allowed.

### Example Query

```sql
field1 = "value1" AND field2 >= 100 ORDER BY field3 DESC, field4 ASC -- This is a comment
```

This query checks for records where `field1` is equal to `"value1"` and `field2` is greater than or equal to `100`, orders the results by `field3` in descending order and then by `field4` in ascending order, ignoring the comment.

## Installation

You can install DasmaQL via npm:

```bash
npm install dasmaql
```

## Usage
Once completed, a backend application will demonstrate how to effectively use the result of the DasmaQL parser.

### Parsing a Query
You can use DasmaQL to parse a DasmaQL query string and obtain a structured model:
```javascript
const dasmaQl = require('dasmaql');

const qlString = 'field1 = value1 and field2 > value2';
const { model, validation } = dasmaQl().parse(qlString);

console.log('Parsed Model:', model);
console.log('Validation:', validation);
```

### Highlighting a Query
DasmaQL also provides a method to highlight a DasmaQL query string:
```javascript
const dasmaQl = require('dasmaql');

const qlString = 'field1 = value1 and field2 > value2';
const highlightedQuery = dasmaQl().highlight(qlString);

console.log('Highlighted Query:', highlightedQuery);
```

### Parsing a Query with Options
You can parse a query with custom options to validate against specific fields and functions:
```javascript
const dasmaQl = require('dasmaql');

const options = {
    fields: ['field1', 'field2'],
    functions: ['function1', 'function2']
};
const qlString = 'field1 = function1() and field2 > value';
const { model, validation } = dasmaQl().parse(qlString, options);

console.log('Parsed Model:', model);
console.log('Validation:', validation);
```

## API Reference
`dasmaQl(options?: object)`
Initializes `DasmaQl` with the specified options, if any. This function returns an object that provides access to the `parse` and `highlight` methods.

* `options`: An optional object that may contain configuration settings for parsing and highlighting. The structure and specific options for this object will depend on the implementation details of DasmaQl.


`parse(qlString: string): { model: object, validation: object }`

Parses the given DasmaQL query string and returns a structured model along with validation details.

* `qlString`: The DasmaQL query string to parse.

`highlight(qlString: string): string`

Highlights the given DasmaQL query string for better readability.

* `qlString`: The DasmaQL query string to highlight.

## Data Structures
`model`

A structured representation of the parsed DasmaQL query.

`validation`

Validation details including whether the query is valid or not, and any invalid fields or functions encountered during parsing.
